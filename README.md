#### About Me

I worked for several years in the medical field as a Chiropractor until a serendipitous event inspired me to get into Software Development, and I love it! I love the creative collaboration and problem solving aspects of the field. There is nothing better than finding the answer to a problem that allows an entire program to run efficiently. I believe that tech companies are at the forefront of an ever-changing business world with their fun and challenging work environments and I feel very lucky to be a part of it. 

I love meeting new people and learning new things. I love being in a room with people who are passionate, creative, and hard-working as it helps bring out the best in myself. I love to network, meet new people, and take on new challenges- so feel free to say hello or send me a message with any of your creative ideas! 

When I'm not working you can find me with my wife and our friends taking in all that New Mexico has to offer. I love to travel and immerse myself in another cities cultures. I am truly a kid at heart, I love to cook, draw, play video games, watch movies, and exercise.
